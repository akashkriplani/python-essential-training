## Extending the Messenger

# Create a class "SaveMessages" that extends the Messenger class that does the following things:

# - Add any messages it receives to a list, along with the time the message was received
# - Use the provided "getCurrentTime" function so that the received message time is a string
# - Contains a method called "printMessages" that prints all collected messages when it's called.

# You might also consider clearing the message list when "printMessages" is called.
